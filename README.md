# zsh-arc

Arc Plugin for Z-Shell.

Arc â€“ a lightweight version control system (VCS) for a mono repository that
stores data in the cloud and uses virtualization of a working copy instead
of downloading all repository data. This allows you to take up disk space only
to store local changes and to optimize the speed of operation (disk cache).
